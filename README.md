We will not discuss about consoles like Xbox, PS4/5, Nintendo Switch or little browser games like the chrome dino. Except the Steam Deck (we will see why), Linux systems have very rarely been invited into the gaming environment natively or promoted at big gamig events. This is one of the main reasons why it's still a domain of enthusiasts, already familiar with Linux environments.

## One of the key players in the development of gaming on Linux systems

For almost 10 years, Valve has always shown interest in the Linux gaming community. In 2013, at the LinuxCon, the PDG of Valve Gabe Newell presented SteamOS 1.0, a Linux distribution based on a fork of Debian 7 (Wheezie) designed to become the reference operating system for the gaming on PC. Even Linus Torvalds praised the idea of SteamOS, saying that it would force other development studios to take Linux seriously. Especially if game developers start to boycott Windows.

Valve intended to make SteamOS a viable alternative of the Windows systems and to give a whole new ecosystem for the gamers with a Steam account. In 2015, Valve announced Steam Machines with the new SteamOS 2.0 (based on Debian 8), a new hybrid gaming console between PC and home console (like Playstation or Xbox). The goal of theses consoles was to attract both the PC gamers abd the home console gamers. But it was a huge commercial failure. Currently, at the time of writing, when you enter the words "Steam machines", you will see a lot articles talking about the death of theses consoles. Of course, the Steam Machines are no longer available for sale now.

### A new hope for Valve and the Linux gaming community

2021 was a crucial year for Linux gaming and even for Gaming in general. In fact, Valve announces the release of the Steam Deck console in July of that year. Due to semiconductor shortage, the console was only available after a few months (at the beginning of 2022 in Europe for example) which did not prevent it from being a real success for the players.

At the same time as the release of the console, Valve also released SteamOS 3.0, based on Arch Linux this time, with a KDE environment. This new version of SteamOS is a real success for the Linux community and it is the first time that a major Linux distribution is used as the base of a gaming console designed for the general public. This is a real step forward for the Linux gaming community.
